            <p id="cover-heading-two">Staff members from HOPE Foundation for Women and Children of Bangladesh traveled by bus to provide free medical care and food to people affected by flooding.The HOPE staff have responded to mudslides and other disasters before in the Cox’s Bazar area where their field hospital is located. They’ve been training emergency response teams since 2017. But this was their first time responding to an emergency far from home, said founder Dr. Iftikher Mahmood.
