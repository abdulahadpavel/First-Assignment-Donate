            <p id="cover-heading-two">Staff members from HOPE Foundation for Women and Children of Bangladesh traveled by bus to provide free medical care and food to people affected by flooding.The HOPE staff have responded to mudslides and other disasters before in the Cox’s Bazar area where their field hospital is located. They’ve been training emergency response teams since 2017. But this was their first time responding to an emergency far from home, said founder Dr. Iftikher Mahmood.

            <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
            <p class="third-paragraph">This is a good exercise for us, away from home. That tells us that we can actually mobilize our team to many other places whenever it’s needed. And also, we can increase [our] capacity; we can expand the team. In case we need thirty people or forty people, we have the experience of traveling to a distant place and giving service without any trouble.</p>

                <h1>Food For Family</h1>
                <p>Here at RGW, we have identified over 100 refugee families and their children to be part of a food protection program. The families are currently living in tent cities in Adana Turkey. The majority of the families are widows with either teen daughters, pre-teen girls, or with a very large family. The families will receive 50 to 75 kilos of food each month for a year, with the aim of helping the young girls to continue their studies. RGW also will be supplying refugee women's and men's homes with over 100 kilos of basic nutritious food every month!</p>

               <h1>Shelter For Family</h1>
                <p>Rotational shelter is Family Promise original shelter model. The rotational shelter model engages a network of community partners, often faith communities, to house families with children in different locations on a rotational basis. This innovative model— mobilizing volunteers to help house families in community space—has helped over one million children and adults in our national network of 200+ Affiliates.</p>

                <h1>Education For Child</h1>
                <p>Around the world, children are deprived of education and learning for various reasons. Poverty remains one of the most obstinate barriers. Children living through economic fragility, political instability, conflict or natural disaster are more likely to be cut off from schooling as are those with disabilities, or from ethnic minorities. In some countries, education opportunities for girls remain severely limited.</p>
